\subsection*{U\+ML Diagrams and Design Desc.}



\subsubsection*{Design Desc}

This program allows the user to process a 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit audio. The user can perform noise gating, echo, or normalization to an 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit, mono or stereo, audio file. The user is able to modify the metadata and can export a C\+SV file with the metadata if they choose to do so.

\paragraph*{Echo}

The {\ttfamily Echo} class allows the user to process their audio file (either 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit) and add an echo. The user can input a specific {\ttfamily delay} that will determine how long it will take the next set of audio to play, causing an echo effect.

\paragraph*{Normalizer}

The {\ttfamily Normalizer} class allows the user to process their audio file (either 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit) and normalize the audio; in layman\textquotesingle{}s terms, the user can select a max value for its audio, and any audio that does not either reach that value, or exceeds that value, will be set to equal the user\textquotesingle{}s inputted max value. This causes the audio to have the same volume throughout the file.

\paragraph*{Noise\+Gate}

The {\ttfamily Noise\+Gate} class allows the user to process their audio file (either 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit) and elimiate sound that is below the given threshold. For example, background noise that does not meet the given threshold will be removed from the audio file.

\paragraph*{File\+Getter}

The {\ttfamily File\+Getter} class allows the user to get files from a string directory.

\paragraph*{Load\+Buffer}

The {\ttfamily Load\+Buffer} class reads the file selected by the user and determines whether or not the selected file contains 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit audio. It then writes the file according to its bit depth and loads the according buffer.

\subsection*{Problems Encountered}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Issues with reading and storing metadata, thus issues with exporting the C\+SV file
\item Binary files cannot be seen like text files, making understanding them difficult
\item Metadata format was an unknown and existing documentation for it was hard to understand
\item Metadata could not easilty be read in with a struct, causing bulky code
\item Metadata was not easy to write, causing bulky code
\item Difficulty getting Doxygen to install
\item Difficulty getting Doxygen to generate inheritance and collaboration charts
\item Difficulty adapting pre-\/existing processors to work for 16-\/bit audio
\item Difficulty reading in files from different directories
