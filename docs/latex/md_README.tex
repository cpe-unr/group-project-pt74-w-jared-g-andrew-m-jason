\subsection*{U\+ML Diagrams and Design Desc.}



\subsubsection*{Design Desc}

This program allows the user to process a 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit audio. The user can perform noise gating, echo, or normalization to an 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit, mono or stereo, audio file. The user is able to modify the metadata and can export a C\+SV file with the metadata if they choose to do so.

\paragraph*{\hyperlink{classEcho}{Echo}}

The {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classEcho}{Echo}} class allows the user to process their audio file (either 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit) and add an echo. The user can input a specific {\ttfamily delay} that will determine how long it will take the next set of audio to play, causing an echo effect.

\paragraph*{\hyperlink{classNormalizer}{Normalizer}}

The {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classNormalizer}{Normalizer}} class allows the user to process their audio file (either 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit) and normalize the audio; in layman\textquotesingle{}s terms, the user can select a max value for its audio, and any audio that does not either reach that value, or exceeds that value, will be set to equal the user\textquotesingle{}s inputted max value. This causes the audio to have the same volume throughout the file.

\paragraph*{\hyperlink{classNoiseGate}{Noise\+Gate}}

The {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classNoiseGate}{Noise\+Gate}} class allows the user to process their audio file (either 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit) and elimiate sound that is below the given threshold. For example, background noise that does not meet the given threshold will be removed from the audio file.

\paragraph*{File\+Getter}

The {\ttfamily File\+Getter} class allows the user to get files from a string directory.

\paragraph*{Load\+Buffer}

The {\ttfamily Load\+Buffer} class reads the file selected by the user and determines whether or not the selected file contains 8-\/bit or 16-\/bit audio. It then writes the file according to its bit depth and loads the according buffer.

\subsection*{Problems Encountered}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Issues with reading and storing metadata, thus issues with exporting the C\+SV file
\item Difficulty getting Doxygen to install
\item Difficulty getting Doxygen to generate inheritance and collaboration charts
\item Difficulty adapting pre-\/existing processors to work for 16-\/bit audio 
\end{DoxyItemize}
